                                <p>
                                    Before Charity: Water, towns struggled with dirty water and daily hardship. Children missed school, and families worried about illness. After a clean water project, everything changed: safe water flows, health improves, and the whole community is happier and more hopeful. Your support makes this transformation possible!
